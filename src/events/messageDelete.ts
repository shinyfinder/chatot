 * messageDelete handler
 *
 * Event handler for when a message is deleted.
 * Deleted messages have their author, content, and person who deleted the message logged to the specified channel in the config file.
 * Content information is supplied by the audit log.
 *
 * Note that there is no guarantee when the audit log is populated, nor an event when it is.
 * If the person who deleted the message is a bot or the author, no audit log event is created.
 *
 * Deleting a bot message does not trigger the event
